Testing the function failed see weather_retrieval_26_02_2025.log
Statistics at openweather show no api call has been detected.
Log-file indicates a problem establishing connection.
Code was tried on several devices and in different internet connection settings.
The next steps should be again inspecting code syntax, then checking if other libraries/ packages are missing.
